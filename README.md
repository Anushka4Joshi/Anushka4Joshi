- 👋 Hi, I’m Anushka

I'm a final year Electronics and Communication Major student with a keen interest in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science. I have explored a small part of the humongously evolving field of computer science and continue to do so.
- 👀 Anything related to technology and design kindles an interest in me.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring my way through Machine Learning techniques and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some open source projects.
